## Fitting Shelves Problem

Given length of wall w and shelves of two lengths m and n, find the number of each type of shelf to be used and the remaining empty space in the optimal solution so that the empty space is minimum. The larger of the two shelves is cheaper so it is preferred. However cost is secondary and first priority is to minimize empty space on wall.
